    <p>Divyanshi is an enthusiastic 18-year-old Indian girl with an inspiring personal story of courage and resilience. She was diagnosed with HIV at a very young age. She has never given up on her dreams.

        “I became aware of my status around 2013-14 but it wasn’t until I moved to a care home that I understood the challenges of living with this virus,” said Divyanshi. “As a person living with HIV, I face stigma and discrimination when a friend or someone else gets to know about my positive status. But I take it as an opportunity to educate people about HIV and break their myths. I want to show the world that I can live a normal, healthy, and happy life as a person living with HIV.”
        
        Divyanshi joined the Positive YUVA Network (PYN)—an innovative community-based organisation striving to uplift young people living with HIV—where she found support and guidance from her peers.
        
        As a network of young people living with HIV, Positive YUVA Network is a community-based organization committed to support young people living with HIV and LGBTQI+ people in India. The organization focuses its efforts on supporting the mental health of the young people living with HIV through its “Buddy System”. This initiative acknowledges the psychological challenges experienced by young people living with HIV and supports them with professional counsellors who provide tailored assistance.
